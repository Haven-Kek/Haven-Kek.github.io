tagline: pestering you with my opinions
description: This website is about two things: Gaming news and blogs. Both will be picked and written by me, but the aim is to be a more condensed gaming news website compare to the big ones out there. I am very unhappy with all the advertising and click-bait-opinions of most gaming websites. Not all are completely bad, but I never found a website for gaming news that I was satisfied with and so I thought: "Why not make one myself? I can't be the only one having this impression."
Apart from news that I find relevant, there will be blogs. At least if I ever finish writing one.

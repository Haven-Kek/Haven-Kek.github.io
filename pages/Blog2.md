description: Exploring meta gear systems and their interactions

Oh boy, here I go writing again. This will be a long one probably. Where to start even?

Honestly (you may call me crazy but hear me out) I think the three systems are not totally bad in principle, but are just ridiculously implemented and balanced.
Before we get into the interactions of those system I will talk about each of them in turn exclusively.

**Azerite Armor and Traits**

Let us start a bit more general here. I often read about people saying that they want just gear without the fancy shit on it. But the thing is, that systems like Azerite and Artifact Weapons are in some way a symptom of the fact that levelling is no major part of the game any more (at least concerning time). I myself would like them to implement new talent tiers for each class with new expansions, but the problem is that you have achieved that in a very short amount of time, because levelling is such a nuisance at this point. But if you combine the idea of new talents with endgame progression systems you get something like Azerite traits. Do not get me wrong, I am not defending the Azerite System or the traits themselves, I am not even saying they are okay substitutes for new talent tiers. I just want to give you some understanding on why systems like that are developed in the first place. Of course, I am only thinking that it is this way, I have no proof. To summarize: Levelling is no important part of the game any more, but something people just get over with. To make up for that missing progression and time sink, there are systems like Artifact Weapons and Azerite that give importance and meaning in a way similar to levelling in the past, just that you do it a max level. I think there is justification for such systems.

Like I said, I still want to see new talent tiers and stuff (especially for pvp) but I will top talking about that now, because this entry will be a behemoth anyway, I will talk about talents in a future post.

So, lets analyse the Azerite Trait system itself. To spoiler you right ahead of time, we will see a recurring theme: That many of the problems these systems have would be mitigated to a good amount by better balancing and design.

Why are there different Traits on different Azerite pieces? I have no reasonable idea for that honestly. If you don't want people to feel bad about their pieces (which they hopefully don't) you have either try to guarantee that there are no items that feel substantially worse than the others or give them control and RNG mitigation to get what they want in a reasonable amount of time and even better with a roughly foreseeable timeframe. Unfortunately they fail at both. There completely necessary and completely useless traits on some azerite pieces and the mechanic that should normally mitigate RNG for Azerite pieces, namely Titan Residuum, is just another slot machine if you don't wait for a very long amount of time. My warrior still has only 450 azerite pieces despite doing pve and pve chests every week and doing the raid. And again: This would not be a problem or rather would not feel as bad if I did not have like 200k less hp in arena than most other players because they have so much stamina on them (and we did not talk about the damage yet).

Another thing you make very hard to do is experimentation. Because the traits I can use are dependent on the pieces I get I cannot experiment with different playstyles or builds. People sim their stuff anyway and If I want to screw around with talents and traits for fun I just cannot do that. Maybe there is some other viable build that is just slightly worse than the sim optimum but I will probably never be able to find I, because I cannot try it out, so I will stick to the sim recommendation and in the worst case even feel bad if I don't get the max dps simmed traits.

Next, I have no clue why you can skill 5 itemlevels in the middle slot of Azerite items. It is not satisfying, it is not interesting. Why isn't there a very cool active ability or talent for your spec?

And the traits themselves. Some are fine, some are actually very fun and some are complete humbug. Positive examples are the slam proc for warrior which feels kinda good, (but points to a problem of warrior. The slam proc feels good because it is a big it, but this is only possible because warrior feels like a dot class at the moment with no big hits, so the slam proc stands out) same with the life drain trait for affliction warlocks (in arena. It was overpowered at first, but it felt really unique, especially after deleting my beloved Thal'Kiel). And then there are total failures like the Overpower shockwave and the Kill Command Dire Beast proc.

Are route you could have gone down with Azerite Traits is to shift the dmg weighting on your abilities. Just as an example melees obviously like dot dmg because they don't have to stick to their target to keep this dmg up in pvp for example. Maybe this strategy would also be useful for a movement heavy or low uptime raid boss. If you now would have traits that modified your abilities in a way to do more dot based dmg, which is in turn overall lower, there could be situations where it is useful. You see this with the Test of Might trait. It is by far the best warrior trait for a full uptime boss. But just imagine a boss fight that has about 10 second intervals of fighting and running around, the trait would be absolutely useless. The thing is that such a design direction would have to go hand in hand with intricate bossfight an combat systems design and would move WoW further away from a typical MMORPG.

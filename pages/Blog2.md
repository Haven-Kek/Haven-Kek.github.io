description: Exploring meta gear systems and their interactions

Oh boy, here I go writing again. This will be a long one probably. Where to start even?

Honestly (you may call me crazy but hear me out) I think the three systems are not totally bad in principle, but are just ridiculously implemented and balanced.
Before we get into the interactions of those system I will talk about each of them in turn exclusively.

**Azerite Armor and Traits**

Let us start a bit more general here. I often read about people saying that they want just gear without the fancy shit on it. But the thing is, that systems like Azerite and Artifact Weapons are in some way a symptom of the fact that levelling is no major part of the game any more (at least concerning time). I myself would like them to implement new talent tiers for each class with new expansions, but the problem is that you have achieved that in a very short amount of time, because levelling is such a nuisance at this point. But if you combine the idea of new talents with endgame progression systems you get something like Azerite traits. Do not get me wrong, I am not defending the Azerite System or the traits themselves, I am not even saying they are okay substitutes for new talent tiers. I just want to give you some understanding on why systems like that are developed in the first place. Of course, I am only thinking that it is this way, I have no proof. To summarize: Levelling is no important part of the game any more, but something people just get over with. To make up for that missing progression and time sink, there are systems like Artifact Weapons and Azerite that give importance and meaning in a way similar to levelling in the past, just that you do it a max level. I think there is justification for such systems.

Like I said, I still want to see new talent tiers and stuff (especially for pvp) but I will top talking about that now, because this entry will be a behemoth anyway, I will talk about talents in a future post.

So, lets analyse the Azerite system itself.

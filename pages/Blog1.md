description: Why guns suck and bows don't in the World of Warcraft
---

In recent years there was a trend of including bows in many triple A games. Honestly, I am not the biggest fan of that development, because I prefer guns from an aesthetic standpoint. So, if I can pick a gun or a bow in a game, you can rely on me taking the gun. WoW is one of the few games that makes me take the bow. Unfortunately this is not because bows are so well designed (they are good though), but because guns are so unsatisfying for me in both sound and animation.

Lets start with the animations. There are slightly different animations based on the race you are playing. Orcs have an animation like they are priming an old American Civil War rifle, female Draenei look like they are reloading a pump action shotgun. The latter is okay for rifles but looks totally ridiculous on crossbows. Same goes for the orc animation when applied to crossbows.
